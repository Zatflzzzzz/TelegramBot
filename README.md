# Telegram Bot Helper for Choosing a Device

This is my first project written in **Java**, using the **Spring Framework**. The project implements a Telegram bot that helps users choose devices based on their preferences or requirements.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the application.
- **Telegram Bot API**: To integrate with Telegram and create a bot.
- **Maven**: For dependency management and project build.
- **Lombok**: To reduce boilerplate code.
- **SLF4J**: For logging functionality.
- **Docker** (optional): To containerize the application for deployment.

---

## Features

- **Device Selection Assistance**: The bot interacts with users to help them select a device (e.g., a smartphone, laptop, etc.) based on specified criteria.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and easy-to-use interface via Telegram.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the bot, ensure you have the following:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Make sure you have JDK 17 or higher installed.
2. **Spring Framework**: The project uses Spring Boot for simplicity and scalability.
3. **Telegram Bot Token**: You'll need a token for your bot, which you can obtain by creating a bot in Telegram.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>

### 2. Set Up Your Bot in Telegram

#### If you donâ€™t have a bot yet, follow these steps to create one:

    Open Telegram and search for BotFather.
    Start a chat with the BotFather by clicking the "Start" button.
    Use the /newbot command to create a new bot.
    Follow the instructions to provide:
        A name for your bot (e.g., DeviceHelperBot).
        A unique username ending with bot (e.g., DeviceHelperBot).
    Once created, BotFather will send you a token. Save this token, as you'll need it to configure your bot.

### 3. Configure the Application

To run the bot, you need to provide the following fields in the application.properties file (or pass them as environment variables):
properties

bot.name=YourBotUsernameHere
bot.token=YourTelegramBotTokenHere

Replace YourBotUsernameHere and YourTelegramBotTokenHere with the actual values for your bot.

### 4. Build and Run the Project

Use the following steps to build and run the application:

    Build the project:
    bash

./mvnw clean package

Run the application:
bash

    java -jar target/<your-jar-file>.jar

How to Use the Bot

Once the bot is up and running:

    Open Telegram and find your bot using its username.
    Start a conversation by clicking the "Start" button.
    Follow the bot's instructions to get device recommendations.
